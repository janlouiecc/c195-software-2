Directions
When the program is initiated, a user will have to log in with the credentials that matches what is in the current MySQL database.
A log keeps track of all login attempts, and once in, you will be able to add and update customers and/or appointments and also view reports.
Updating appointments should not be done on test data currently in database, but on data that has been added by the user due to test data not being an accurate representation of what should be stored.

Additional Report of Choice
The additional report that I've chosen is to view appointments by customer selection. Once a customer is selected, only appointments associated with that customer will be showing.
